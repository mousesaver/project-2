# Movie Tracker

## Project idea and description

We all have seen many movies and sometimes we don't remember whether we have seen them before. Therefore a movie tracker app will come handy. You can not only mark the movie that you have seen but also add movies to a watchlist so that you will remember to watch them. You can see the top 10 movies by view times and top 10 movie viewers by the number of movies they have seen.
