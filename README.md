# Movie Tracker

## Project idea and description

We all have seen many movies and sometimes we don't remember whether we have seen them before. Therefore a movie tracker app will come handy. You can not only mark the movie that you have seen but also add movies to a watchlist so that you will remember to watch them. You can also comment on movies and see other people's comments too.
